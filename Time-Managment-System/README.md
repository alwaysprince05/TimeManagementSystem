The Time Management System is a web application that allows users to manage tasks, set deadlines, and track time spent on each task. Users can create, edit, delete, and prioritize tasks, while a built-in time tracker helps monitor time spent on each task. The app stores task data in Local Storage and time data in Session Storage for persistence, and includes features like task search, filtering, and validation for missing fields. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
